Lightweight 2D mapping using monocular depth estimation (MiDaS-small).



This repository focuses on projecting depth maps into a 1D LiDAR-like

representation and validating polar coordinate projection. The depth

maps are created using MIDAS-small at an Android phone and projected

over an occupancy grid at the main machine.
